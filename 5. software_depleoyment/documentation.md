  ```

### 3. API Documentation

- **Purpose**: Guide developers in integrating with external systems
- **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "endpoint": "/api/v1/payments",
    "method": "POST",
    "parameters": {
      "amount": "number (required)",
      "currency": "string (required)",
      "description": "string (optional)"
    },
    "response": {
      "transaction_id": "string",
      "status": "string",
      "timestamp": "datetime"
    }
  }
  ```

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear and Accessible Documentation

- Use simple language
- Avoid unnecessary technical jargon
- Example of Good vs Bad Documentation:

  ```
  ❌ Bad:
  "Utilize the authentication mechanism to facilitate user access"

  ✅ Good:
  "Log in with your email and password to access your account"
  ```

### 2. Documentation as Part of Development

- **Concurrent Documentation**: Write documentation alongside code
- **Example Workflow**:
  ```mermaid
  graph LR
    A[Code Change] --> B[Update Documentation]
    B --> C[Code Review]
    C --> D[Testing]
    D --> E[Deployment]
  ```

### 3. Standardized Templates

- **Example Template Structure**:

  ```markdown
  # Component Name

  ## Overview

  Brief description of the component

  ## Dependencies

  List of required libraries/modules

  ## Installation

  Step-by-step setup instructions

  ## Usage

  Code examples and use cases

  ## Error Handling

  Common errors and solutions
  ```
