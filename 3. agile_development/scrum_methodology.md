# Scrum Methodology

## Introduction

Scrum is one of the most widely adopted Agile frameworks, designed to improve collaboration, adaptability, and efficiency in software development. Created in the early 1990s by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, Scrum provides a structured yet flexible approach to managing complex projects through iterative development cycles.

## Historical Background

- Developed in early 1990s to address traditional project management limitations
- Named after the rugby formation, emphasizing teamwork and adaptability
- Built on principles from manufacturing and empirical process control
- Has revolutionized software development team operations

## Core Roles

### 1. Product Owner

**Responsibilities**:

- Represents stakeholders
- Defines product vision
- Manages product backlog
- Prioritizes features

**Example**:
In a web-based e-commerce project:

- Prioritizes features based on business value and customer needs

  - Payment integration: Implementation of payment processing systems (credit cards, PayPal, etc.)
    - Why prioritize this?
      - Essential for completing transactions
      - Directly impacts revenue generation
      - Critical for customer trust and security
      - Required for basic e-commerce functionality
  - Social sharing: Features that allow users to share products on social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
    - Why lower priority?
      - Nice-to-have feature, not essential
      - Can be added after core functionality
      - Marketing benefit but not critical for transactions
      - Can be implemented in later sprints

- Makes strategic decisions about feature implementation based on business value

  - Example Scenario: Limited development resources require choosing between two features
    - Search functionality: Product search features (keyword search, filters, etc.)
      - Business value: Improves customer experience by making products easier to find
      - Impact: Reduces bounce rate and increases conversion
    - User reviews: Customer review and rating system for products
      - Business value: Builds trust and social proof
      - Impact: Increases average order value and customer retention
  - Decision process:
    - Analyzes customer feedback and market research
    - Considers development effort vs. expected ROI
    - Makes final decision based on business priorities

- Works with stakeholders to define MVP features
  - MVP (Minimum Viable Product): The most basic version of a product that can be released
    - Includes only essential features needed for the product to function
    - Example for e-commerce: Product browsing, cart functionality, and basic checkout
    - Additional features (reviews, wishlists, social sharing) can be added in later iterations

### 2. Scrum Master

**Responsibilities**:

- Facilitates Scrum process
- Removes obstacles
- Ensures Agile principles are followed
- Protects team from external interruptions

**Example**:

- Helps resolve deployment pipeline issues
- Coordinates with IT for development environment access
- Facilitates communication between development team and external departments

### 3. Development Team

**Responsibilities**:

- Cross-functional professionals
- Self-organizing
- Delivers working software increments
- Estimates and plans sprint work

**Example**:
Typical web development team composition:

- Frontend developers (React/Vue.js specialists)
- Backend developers (Node.js/Python developers)
- QA engineers
- UX/UI designers
- DevOps engineers

## Scrum Ceremonies

### 1. Sprint Planning

**Duration**: 2-4 hours for a 2-week sprint

**Activities**:

- Review and select items from product backlog
- Break down items into tasks
- Estimate effort
- Set sprint goal

**Example**:
Planning for an e-commerce feature sprint:
Sprint Goal: Implement basic shopping cart functionality
Selected Items:

- Add items to cart
- Remove items from cart
- Update quantities
- Calculate total
- Save cart state

### 2. Daily Stand-up

**Duration**: 15 minutes

**Format**:
Each team member answers:

- What did I complete yesterday?
- What will I work on today?
- Are there any blockers? (What is preventing you from making progress?)

**Example**:

```
Developer A:
✓ Yesterday: Completed shopping cart API endpoints
→ Today: Implementing cart state persistence
! Blocker: Needs AWS S3 access for storage

- Issue: Cannot save cart data without storage access
- Impact: Development progress is blocked
- Action needed: Request AWS S3 access from IT department

Common types of blockers:

- Technical issues (e.g., server access, API limitations)
- Dependencies on other teams or departments
- Missing information or requirements
- Resource constraints
- External factors (e.g., third-party service issues)
```

### 3. Sprint Review

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

**Activities**:

- Demo completed features
- Gather stakeholder feedback
- Update product backlog

**Example**:
Demo Items:

- Show working shopping cart functionality
- Demonstrate cart persistence across sessions
- Present mobile responsiveness
- Show performance metrics

### 4. Sprint Retrospective

**Duration**: 1-1.5 hours

**Format**:
Discuss:

- What went well?
- What could be improved?
- Action items for next sprint

**Example**:

```
Positives:
✓ Successful implementation of cart functionality
✓ Good team collaboration

Improvements:
! Better estimation needed for API integration
! More thorough code reviews

Actions:
→ Create estimation checklist
→ Set up pair programming sessions
```

## Sprint Structure

**Duration**: 1-4 weeks (typically 2 weeks)

**Typical Two-Week Sprint Timeline**:

```
Day 1: Sprint Planning
Days 2-11: Development & Daily Stand-ups
Day 12: Feature Freeze & Testing
Day 13: Sprint Review
Day 14: Sprint Retrospective
```
