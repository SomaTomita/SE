    - Performance
    - Security
    - Usability
    - Reliability

  coverage:
    - Risk-based prioritization
    - Requirements traceability
    - User acceptance criteria
```

This approach ensures:

1. Complete coverage of all requirements
2. Balance between functional and non-functional aspects
3. Risk-appropriate testing depth
4. Comprehensive quality assessment

### Question 2: Testing Tools Selection

```python
class TestToolStrategy:
    def recommend_tools(self):
        tool_stack = {
            "performance_testing": {
                "tool": "JMeter",
                "benefits": [
                    "Load testing capabilities",
                    "Scalability testing",
                    "Resource monitoring",
                    "Detailed performance metrics"
                ],
                "use_cases": [
                    "High-load scenarios",
                    "Stress testing",
                    "Endurance testing",
                    "Spike testing"
                ]
            }
        }
        return self.evaluate_tool_effectiveness(tool_stack)
```

### Question 3: Test Coverage Approach

**Question:**
What approach would you take to ensure comprehensive test coverage?

**Options:**

- Include edge cases, boundary values, and negative scenarios in test cases
- Skip manual testing if automated tools are available
- Create a traceability matrix to map test cases to requirements
- Focus testing efforts only on core application features

**Answer: Include edge cases, boundary values, and negative scenarios in test cases**

**Explanation:**
Comprehensive coverage requires:

```yaml
Test Coverage Strategy:

1. Boundary Value Analysis:
  - User name is 1 character, password maximum length 256 characters
  - Age is 17 (NG), 18 (OK), 19 (OK)
  - Email address is blank, incorrect format like abc@, SQL in input tag

2. Equivalence Partitioning:
  - Age input → 18–60 is valid, below 18 or above 60 is invalid, 17/18 and 60/61 test borders
  - Payment method → "Credit Card", "PayPal", "Bank Transfer" are valid; "Cash", "Crypto" are invalid
  - File upload size → 0–5MB valid, over 5MB invalid, test with 0MB, 5MB, 5.1MB

3. Negative Testing:
  - Submit form with empty required fields, invalid characters in name, non-numeric age input
  - Simulate 500 Internal Server Error on API call, expired session token, rate limiting threshold
  - Attempt unauthorized admin access, corrupt file upload, invalid date like 31/02/2025

4. Integration Points:
  - API → Validate request/response schemas, error handling on 400/500, timeout simulation
  - Database → Test missing DB connection, rollback on failure, verify data integrity after insert
  - External services → Payment gateway failure, email service down, 3rd-party timeout with fallback
```

### Question 4: Test Automation Integration

**Question:**
How would you integrate automation into your testing process?

**Options:**

- Automate all test cases, including exploratory testing
- Use tools like Selenium and TestNG to create and execute scripts
- Prioritise automating tests for high-risk and high-usage areas
- Automate repetitive test cases such as regression testing

**Answer: Automate repetitive test cases such as regression testing**

**Explanation:**

```yaml
automation_strategy:
  priority_areas:
    regression_testing:
      critical_path_testing:
        - Login flow: "user authentication -> dashboard access -> logout"
        - Purchase flow: "add to cart -> checkout -> payment -> order confirmation"
        - Data operations: "CRUD operations for user profile"
      core_functionality:
        - User registration process
        - Search and filter functionality
        - Payment processing system
      integration_points:
        - API endpoints: "/api/v1/users, /api/v1/orders"

              try:
                  wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "login-form")))
                  # Test implementation
              except TimeoutException:
                  log.error("Login form not loaded")
                  raise

    execution_frequency:
      high_frequency:
        - "Login tests: 100 times/day"
        - "Payment flow: 50 times/day"
      medium_frequency:
        - "Profile updates: 20 times/day"
        - "Search functionality: 30 times/day"

    roi_assessment:
      calculation: |
        ROI = (Time saved per execution × Execution frequency × Cost per hour)
              - (Development time × Cost per hour + Maintenance cost)
      example:
        manual_test_time: "30 minutes"
        automated_test_time: "5 minutes"
        execution_frequency: "100 times/month"
        development_time: "8 hours"
        monthly_savings: "$2000"
      ROI = (0.417h diff × 100 times/m for test × $50/h for test engineer to test)
      - (8h for dev × $50/h for engineer + $200/m for mentainance)
      = ($2085) - ($400 + $200)
      = $1485/m cost saving per month

                    "test_focus": "Functionality, data accuracy"
                }
            },
            "medium": {
                "user_preferences": {
                    "impact": "Low",
                    "probability": "Medium",
                    "priority": 3,
                    "test_focus": "Usability"
                }
            }
        }
        return self.calculate_risk_priority(risk_matrix)
```

2. **Prioritization Strategy**

```yaml
testing_priorities:
  critical_features:

    - Core business logic
    - User authentication

  high_risk_areas:
    - Integration points
    - Performance bottlenecks
    - Data integrity
    - Error handling

  test_allocation:
    critical: "60% of testing effort"
    high: "30% of testing effort"
    medium: "10% of testing effort"
```

3. **Real-world Example:**
   Consider an e-commerce platform:

- Critical: Payment processing (must be tested extensively)

                    "defects_found": 45,
                    "severity": "Low to Medium",
                    "cost_to_fix": "Low"
                },
                "integration_testing": {
                    "defects_found": 30,
                    "severity": "Medium to High",
                    "cost_to_fix": "Medium"
                }
            },
            "post_release": {
                "production": {
                    "defects_found": 5,
                    "severity": "High",
                    "cost_to_fix": "Very High"
                }
            }
        }
        return self.calculate_effectiveness(metrics)
```

2. **Effectiveness Indicators**

```text
Testing Phase Efficiency:
Early Testing (Development) → 1x cost to fix
System Testing → 10x cost to fix
Production → 100x cost to fix

Detection Rate Impact:
High detection rate in early phases = More efficient process
Low detection rate in early phases = Process needs improvement
```
