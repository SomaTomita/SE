## QA Best Practices

### 1. Shift-Left Testing

```text
Traditional Approach:
Development → Testing → Production

Shift-Left Approach:
Testing → Development → Testing → Production
```

Benefits:

- Early defect detection
- Reduced costs
- Faster feedback loops
- Improved quality

### 2. Code Review Process

```python
# Example Code Review Checklist
class CodeReviewChecklist:
    def verify_code_quality(self):
        checks = [
            "Code style compliance",
            "Security vulnerabilities",
            "Performance optimization",
            "Documentation completeness",
            "Test coverage"
        ]
        return all(self.perform_check(check) for check in checks)
```

### 3. Continuous Integration/Deployment

```yaml
# Example CI/CD Pipeline
pipeline:
  stages:
    - code_analysis
    - unit_tests
    - integration_tests
    - security_scan
    - performance_tests
    - deployment
```

### 4. Regular Retrospectives

Key Components:

- Success analysis
- Challenge identification
- Process improvements
- Team feedback
- Action items

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation

- Establish QA processes
- Define quality metrics
- Set up testing infrastructure
- Train team members

### Phase 2: Integration

- Implement automation
- Deploy CI/CD pipelines
- Integrate security testing
- Establish code review processes

### Phase 3: Optimization

- Monitor metrics
- Refine processes
- Enhance automation
- Scale QA practices

# Practice Questions on QA Implementation

### Question: QA in Agile vs Traditional Development

**Question:**
How does Quality Assurance (QA) in Agile software development differ from traditional QA approaches, and what challenges might organisations face when integrating QA into Agile workflows?

**Answer:**

#### Key Differences:

1. **Testing Approach**

   - Traditional QA:
     - Sequential testing phases
     - Comprehensive documentation
     - Separate QA team
     - Testing after development
   - Agile QA:
     - Continuous testing
     - Iterative feedback
     - Integrated QA team
     - Testing throughout development

2. **Documentation**

   - Traditional:
     ```text
     Detailed test plans → Test cases → Test reports
     ```
   - Agile:
     ```text
     User stories → Acceptance criteria → Quick feedback
     ```

3. **Team Structure**

   ```python
   # Traditional QA Structure
   class TraditionalQA:
       def workflow(self):
           phases = [
               "Requirements",
               "Development",
               "QA Testing",
               "Bug Fixes",
               "Release"
           ]

   # Agile QA Structure
   class AgileQA:
       def workflow(self):
           sprint_activities = [
               "Planning",
