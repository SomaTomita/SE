**Answer: The number of defects identified per unit of code**

**Detailed Explanation:**
Defect density is a crucial metric that helps evaluate software quality:

1. **Calculation Method**

   ```python
   class DefectDensityCalculator:
       def calculate_density(self, defects, code_size):
           """
           Calculate defect density
           :param defects: Number of defects
           :param code_size: Size in KLOC (thousands of lines of code)
           :return: Defects per KLOC
           """
           return defects / code_size

       def interpret_density(self, density):
           benchmarks = {
               "excellent": 0.5,  # Less than 0.5 defects per KLOC
               "good": 1.0,      # Less than 1.0 defects per KLOC
               "average": 2.0,   # Less than 2.0 defects per KLOC
               "poor": float('inf')  # More than 2.0 defects per KLOC
           }
           return self.get_quality_level(density, benchmarks)
   ```

2. **Usage in Quality Management:**

   - Project quality tracking
   - Process improvement measurement
   - Team performance evaluation

   ```yaml
   factors_affecting_density:
     code_complexity:
       - Function points
       - Cyclomatic complexity
       - Dependencies

     development_phase:
