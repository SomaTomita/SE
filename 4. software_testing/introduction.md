# Software Testing and Quality Assurance

## Introduction

Software testing and quality assurance are vital for creating reliable software. They help make sure software works correctly and safely before it's released to users.

## What is Software Testing?

- Testing checks if software works correctly after it's built
- Developers and users test parts of the software to find bugs and errors
- Makes sure the software does what users need it to do
- Happens after the software is built (reactive process)

### Types of Testing

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- System testing

## What is Quality Assurance (QA)?

- A planned process to prevent problems before they happen
- Bigger than just testing
- Makes sure developers follow good practices
- Focuses on meeting standards and user needs

### Five Key Parts of QA

1. Testing - Finding and fixing software problems
2. Process Validation - Making sure development follows good practices
3. Quality Control - Checking software at different stages
4. Continuous Improvement - Always making processes better
5. Tools & Techniques - Using special tools to check software quality

## Why They Matter: Real Examples

### Therac-25 Incident (1985-1987)

- A radiation therapy machine gave patients too much radiation
- Software errors caused serious injuries and deaths
- Shows why testing safety systems is important

### London Ambulance Service (1992)

- New dispatch system failed due to poor testing
- Caused delays in emergency responses
- Shows why backup plans and thorough testing matter

### Ariane 5 Rocket (1996)

- Rocket destroyed due to a simple math error in software
- Cost about $370 million in damage
- Shows why careful testing is needed, even for small things

## Simple Comparison: The House Building Example

- Testing is like checking each brick and window in a house
- Quality Assurance is like making sure the whole house is built following proper rules
- Both are needed to build a good, safe house (or software)

## Conclusion

Using both testing and quality assurance helps create better, safer software. While testing finds specific problems, quality assurance prevents problems from happening in the first place. Together, they help make software that users can trust and rely on.
