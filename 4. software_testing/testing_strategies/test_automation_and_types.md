# Test Automation and Types of Testing

## Types of Testing Classifications

### Manual vs. Automated Testing

#### Manual Testing

- Executed by human testers without automation
- Ideal for:
  - Exploratory testing
  - Usability testing
  - Small projects
  - Early-stage testing
  - Scenarios requiring human judgment
- Valuable for complex test scenarios needing human insight

#### Automated Testing

- Uses scripts and tools (Selenium, JUnit, PyTest)
- Best for:
  - Regression testing
  - Large-scale applications
  - Repetitive test cases
- Increases speed and accuracy
- Requires initial investment but saves time long-term

### Functional vs. Non-functional Testing

#### Functional Testing

- Verifies system functions against requirements
- Includes:
  - Unit testing
  - Integration testing
  - System testing
  - User acceptance testing (UAT)

**Example: E-commerce Checkout Process**

```python
def test_checkout_process():
    # Unit Test: Price calculation
    assert calculate_total([10.99, 20.50]) == 31.49

    # Integration Test: Cart and Payment
    cart = ShoppingCart()
    payment = PaymentProcessor()
    assert payment.process(cart) == "SUCCESS"

    # System Test: End-to-end flow
    result = complete_checkout_process(cart, payment, shipping)
    assert result.order_status == "CONFIRMED"
```

#### Non-functional Testing

- Assesses aspects beyond functionality:
  - Performance
  - Security
  - Usability
  - Compatibility
- Critical for overall system quality

**Example: Performance Testing**

```python
def test_website_performance():
    # Load Test: 1000 concurrent users
    response_times = simulate_users(1000, duration="5m")
    assert avg(response_times) < 2.0  # 2 seconds threshold

    # Stress Test: Maximum capacity
    max_users = find_breaking_point()
    assert max_users > 5000  # System requirement
```

### Exploratory vs. Ad-hoc Testing

#### Exploratory Testing

- Simultaneous test design and execution
- Useful when:
  - Documentation is limited
  - Quick issue discovery is needed
- More structured than ad-hoc testing

#### Ad-hoc Testing

- Unstructured approach
- Random testing without predefined cases
- Helps identify unexpected edge cases

**Real-world Example: Mobile App Testing**

- Exploratory Testing:
  ```text
  Scenario: Social Media App
  1. Login with different account types
  2. Post various content formats
  3. Interact with posts in different ways
  4. Document unexpected behaviors
  ```

2. **Automation Tools**

   - **Selenium**: Web application testing
   - **Cypress**: End-to-end testing
   - **JUnit**: Java unit testing
   - **PyUnit**: Python unit testing

3. **Execution Process**
   - Automatic script execution
   - Result comparison
   - Defect reporting
   - Integration with CI/CD

### Modern Practices and Trends

#### Shift-Left Testing

- Early implementation of automated tests
- Defect detection in early stages
- Integration with development process

#### AI-Driven Testing

- Machine learning for test generation
- Pattern prediction
- Coverage optimization

### Best Practices

1. **Test Script Management**

   - Structured script writing
   - Regular maintenance
   - Version control
   - Documentation

**Example: Selenium Test Structure**

```python
class LoginTests(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.driver.get("https://example.com/login")

    def test_valid_login(self):
        self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "username").send_keys("user")
        self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "password").send_keys("pass")
        self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "login-btn").click()
        assert "Dashboard" in self.driver.title

    def tearDown(self):
        self.driver.quit()
```

2. **CI/CD Integration**

   - Automated test execution with each commit
   - Tools:
     - Jenkins
     - GitHub Actions
     - Azure DevOps

**Example: GitHub Actions Workflow**

```yaml
name: Test Automation
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Tests
        run: |
          python -m pytest tests/
          python -m pylint src/
```

3. **Hybrid Approach**

   - Combine manual and automated testing
   - Balance between:
     - Automated regression tests
     - Manual exploratory testing
     - Performance testing
     - Security validation

**Example: Banking Application Testing Strategy**

```text
Automated Tests:
- Daily account balance calculations
- Transaction processing
- API integration tests
- Security compliance checks

Manual Tests:

    # Test service response time
    for _ in range(1000):
        start = time.time()
        response = service.process_request()
        latency = time.time() - start
        assert latency < 0.1  # 100ms threshold
```
