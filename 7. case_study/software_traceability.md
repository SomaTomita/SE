# Case Study: Software Traceability Analysis

## Question 3: (maximum of 300 words)

Software designs often drift from original requirements. Using an example, discuss how traceability can be maintained between requirements (elicited in requirement file) and design/architecture decisions (explored in refered fles). What risks arise if traceability is weak or missing?

## Answer

Maintaining bidirectional traceability between requirements and architectural decisions is the guard-rail that prevents software from drifting away from stakeholder intent while still enabling evolution. Imagine a hospital's electronic health-records (EHR) platform whose core requirement states: "clinical staff must retrieve any patient record within three seconds while remaining HIPAA-compliant." That single statement cascades into several design choicesâ€”an authentication-isolation microservice, a distributed in-memory cache, zero-trust network segmentation, and a seven-year audit-log store.

Traceability is sustained through a lightweight, living chain of artefacts. The requirement in the Confluence specification receives a stable key (REQ-042). Architectural Decision Record ADR-15 embeds that key, justifies the caching strategy, and is referenced from the cache microservice's README and the related user-journey test in the CI pipeline. Jira will not accept a pull request unless at least one REQ-id is attached. A nightly script produces a coverage report highlighting any requirement without code or tests, exposing erosion before it becomes costly.

Yet the discipline is not free. Capturing links, updating ADRs, and policing coverage typically adds five-to-ten percent effort per sprint. That overhead is justified in regulated domains, multi-vendor programmes, or products expected to live for a decade, because it slashes audit time and accelerates onboarding. Conversely, in a two-week proof-of-concept the same rigour can throttle discovery speed; here a simple decision log and disposable test harness may suffice until requirements stabilise.

When traceability is weak or missing, silent non-compliance, hidden rework, and brittle change follow. A refactor of the cache-eviction policy, if detached from REQ-042, might push response time beyond three seconds and trigger regulatory penalties before anyone notices. By contrast, explicit links shrink impact-analysis time, enable confident change, and let every engineer walk any significant line of code back to the original "why."

   - Uses realistic healthcare EHR system example
   - Shows concrete technical implementations
   - Demonstrates multiple levels of traceability
   - Examples:
     - Specific requirement (REQ-042) traced through multiple system components
     - Clear chain from business rule (3-second retrieval) to technical solution (distributed cache)
     - Security requirement mapping to authentication-isolation microservice

3. **Implementation Strategy**

   - Details specific tools and processes

## Glossary of Technical Terms and Methodologies

1. **Bidirectional Traceability**
   The ability to trace requirements both forward to their implementation and backward to their origin, ensuring complete coverage and impact analysis.
   _Example: Tracing a performance requirement through design decisions to code implementation, and vice versa._

2. **Architectural Decision Record (ADR)**
   A document that captures important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences.
   _Example: ADR-15 documenting the choice and justification of a distributed caching strategy._

3. **Living Chain of Artifacts**
   An interconnected set of documentation, code, and tests that evolves together and maintains consistent relationships.
   _Example: Requirement specification linked to architecture documents, which link to code and tests._

4. **Coverage Report**
   An automated analysis showing how well requirements are implemented and tested in the codebase.
   _Example: Nightly report showing which requirements lack corresponding tests or implementation._

5. **Zero-trust Network Segmentation**
   A security architecture that requires verification of every person and device trying to access resources in a network.

6. **Impact Analysis**
   The process of identifying all system components affected by a proposed change.
   _Example: Determining which services and tests need updating when modifying a cache policy._

7. **Requirement Key**
   A unique identifier assigned to each requirement for consistent reference throughout the system.
