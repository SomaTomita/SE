# Case Study: Public Waste Management System Requirements Elicitation

## Question 1: (maximum of 300 words)

A large city council is procuring a new public waste management system to handle citizen reports, route optimisation for collection vehicles, and integration with environmental impact reporting. Initial stakeholder workshops revealed tension between operational managers (focused on logistical efficiency), council representatives (focused on compliance and budget), and residents (focused on service quality and responsiveness). Some voices, particularly from underrepresented neighbourhoods, were noticeably absent or quiet during sessions.

## Task

Based on this scenario, which elicitation techniques would be most effective in uncovering conflicting, implicit, or politically sensitive requirements? How could these techniques be adapted to mitigate power imbalances or stakeholder resistance?

## Answer

To surface politically sensitive, conflicting, and tacit requirements while counter-balancing power asymmetries, a phased, mutually reinforcing elicitation strategy is recommended. First, mobile ethnographic shadowing of collection crews and street-level observation in under-represented districts reveals routine work-arounds and pain points invisible in meetings; its weakness—time cost and limited insight into intent—is offset next by semi-structured narrative interviews with residents and crew members, which clarify motives but risk courtesy bias. The findings feed directly into an affinity-mapping workshop where representatives from all groups co-cluster observations into themes; facilitators use silent-brain-writing and colour-coded voting to equalise voice and expose contested priorities.

In the second phase, Joint Application Development (JAD) sessions are run in "power-balanced pairs": each resident sits with an operational manager at the same workstation to sketch interface wire-frames or co-optimise a sample route. Such participatory design fosters empathy but may drift into detail; time-boxed design sprints and a roaming coach keep focus on requirements.

Scenario-based "pressure-tests" follow: facilitators present provocative what-if stories (e.g., sudden budget cuts or illegal-dumping spikes) and ask mixed tables to revise earlier artefacts. Scenarios externalise conflict, making political trade-offs discussable, yet they can feel abstract, so facilitators anchor them in data from the earlier ethnography.

Finally, an online suggestion board and quarterly pop-up kiosks ensure continuous, low-barrier feedback once deployment begins; their known drawback—signal-to-noise ratio—is mitigated through sentiment-analysis dashboards that highlight recurring issues for rapid triage.

The sequence is intentionally layered: observation uncovers behaviour, interviews expose rationales, co-design translates insights into artefacts, scenarios stress-test commitments, and continuous channels capture emergent needs. By explicitly pairing each technique with a compensating method and safeguard, the approach delivers a more complete, credible, and politically resilient requirements set within the council's limit.

## Glossary of Technical Terms and Methodologies

1. **Ethnographic Shadowing**
   A qualitative research method where researchers closely follow and observe participants in their natural work environment, documenting their activities, interactions, and routines to gain deep insights into their daily experiences and challenges.
   _Example: Following a waste collection crew throughout their morning route to observe how they handle unexpected situations like blocked access or oversized waste._

2. **Street-Level Observation**
   Direct observation of activities and behaviors in the actual environment where services are delivered, allowing researchers to witness real-world interactions and identify issues that might not be apparent in formal meetings.
   _Example: Watching how residents interact with waste bins in different neighborhoods, noting common issues like bin placement or sorting difficulties._

3. **Semi-Structured Narrative Interviews**
   An interview technique that combines prepared questions with the flexibility to explore emerging themes, allowing interviewees to share their experiences and perspectives in a story-like format while ensuring key topics are covered.
   _Example: Asking residents to describe their typical waste disposal routine, then following up with specific questions about challenges they face._

4. **Silent Brain-Writing and Color-Coded Voting**
   A participatory technique where participants write ideas silently to avoid dominance by vocal individuals, followed by a voting system using colors to categorize and prioritize ideas while maintaining anonymity and reducing power imbalances.
   _Example: Participants write suggestions for improving waste collection on sticky notes, then use green dots for high priority, yellow for medium, and red for low priority voting._

5. **Joint Application Development (JAD) Sessions**
   Structured workshops where stakeholders work together to design and develop system requirements, featuring direct interaction between users and technical staff to ensure requirements accurately reflect user needs.
   _Example: A resident and system developer working together to design a mobile app interface for reporting missed collections._

6. **Interface Wireframes and Route Co-optimization**
   Collaborative design activities where stakeholders jointly create basic visual layouts of user interfaces and work together to optimize service delivery routes, combining technical expertise with practical user experience.
   _Example: Residents and route planners collaboratively sketching a map interface that shows both efficient collection routes and areas with frequent access issues._

7. **What-If Stories**
   Scenario-based exercises that present hypothetical but realistic situations to stakeholders, helping them explore potential system responses to various challenges and identify requirements that might not be apparent in normal operations.
   _Example: "What if there's a major festival in the city center? How should the system handle the temporary increase in waste and changed access routes?"_

8. **Mixed Tables**
   A deliberate arrangement in workshops where different stakeholder groups (e.g., residents, managers, council representatives) are mixed at tables to encourage diverse perspectives and foster understanding across groups.
   _Example: Seating a resident, a collection crew member, and a council budget manager together to discuss system notification preferences._

9. **Ethnographic Data**
   Information collected through detailed observation and documentation of people's behaviors, practices, and interactions in their natural environment, providing rich contextual insights into how systems are actually used.
   _Example: Photos and notes showing how elderly residents struggle with heavy bin manipulation, leading to requirements for assisted collection services._

10. **Pop-up Kiosks**
    Temporary physical locations set up in community spaces to gather feedback and input from residents, making it easier for people to participate without having to attend formal meetings or use digital platforms.
    _Example: Setting up a booth at a local shopping center where residents can test a prototype of the new waste reporting app and provide immediate feedback._

11. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**
    In the context of feedback systems, this refers to the proportion of useful feedback (signal) compared to irrelevant or redundant information (noise), affecting the quality and usefulness of collected data.
    _Example: From 100 resident complaints, identifying 20 actionable issues about bin placement while filtering out general frustrations about waste management policies._

12. **Triage**
    A systematic process of prioritizing issues or requirements based on urgency, impact, and available resources, borrowed from medical practice and applied to project management to ensure efficient handling of multiple competing demands.
    _Example: Prioritizing system features by categorizing them as "Critical" (missed collection reporting), "Important" (route optimization), or "Nice to Have" (waste statistics dashboard)._
