# Academic Advising Platform Requirements Elicitation

## Question (maximum of 150 words)

Identify three elicitation techniques that would be most effective for uncovering conflicting requirements for a university that aims to create a new academic advising platform. The platform must serve students, academic advisors, and program coordinators. During early discussions, stakeholders raised conflicting needs; for example, students requested flexible meeting times, while coordinators demanded strict scheduling controls.

Your response should clearly name the technique and briefly explain how the technique would help expose conflicts between stakeholder needs.

## Answer

The three most effective elicitation techniques for uncovering conflicting requirements in the academic advising platform are Stakeholder Viewpoint Analysis, Facilitated Workshops, and Joint Application Development (JAD).

Stakeholder Viewpoint Analysis systematically captures and reconciles different perspectives by creating a viewpoint matrix that maps each stakeholder's goals, concerns, and KPIs. This technique exposes conflicts between students' desire for flexible scheduling and coordinators' need for strict control by documenting and tracing conflicting requirements through a structured conflict log.

Facilitated Workshops bring all stakeholders together in time-boxed, structured sessions led by a facilitator. This technique helps surface conflicts early through direct cross-functional dialogue, enabling immediate conflict resolution and consensus-building on prioritized features.

JAD sessions utilize rapid prototyping and UI sketches to make abstract discussions concrete. By walking through as-is and to-be models with all stakeholders, JAD helps expose practical implications of conflicting requirements and facilitates agreement on balanced solutions that meet diverse stakeholder needs.
