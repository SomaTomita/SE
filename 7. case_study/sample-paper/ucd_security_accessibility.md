# UCD for Security and Accessibility System Redesign

## Question 4 (Maximum 150 words)

User-Centred Design (UCD) aims to embed user needs throughout system development. You have been asked to critically assess how UCD principles could guide the redesign of a system facing stakeholder concerns about security and accessibility.

In your response:

- Briefly explain why UCD is an appropriate design philosophy for addressing complex system challenges such as security and accessibility.
- Identify three UCD principles that are most relevant to this context.
- Critically explain how each principle would influence specific design decisions or processes to improve both security and accessibility.

## Assessment Criteria

- Brief rationale for why UCD is suitable for complex redesign challenges (security + accessibility), 1 mark
- Correct identification of three appropriate UCD principles, 3 marks (1 per principle)
- Critical explanation of how each principle would shape practical design decisions to improve outcomes, 3 marks (1 per principle)
- Structure, clarity, and critical integration of UCD thinking (not just listing), 1 mark

## Model Answer

User-Centred Design embeds real users in every step, so security and accessibility gaps are detected early and resolved with evidence, not assumptions.

Empathy & Contextual Inquiry enables field studies with screen-reader users, seniors, and privileged admins to reveal assistive-tech limits, cognitive load, and social-engineering paths. These insights drive choices such as text-rather-than-colour alerts and CAPTCHA-free MFA flows that remain usable for all.

Iterative Prototyping & Evaluation means low-fidelity wireframes undergo WCAG audits and red-team scripts each sprint. Rapid feedback refines keyboard-only navigation, timeout lengths, and encryption prompts, letting the team trade off usability against risk before costly build stages.

User Control & Feedback (ISO 9241) implements transparent consent dashboards, live password-strength meters, and undoable actions to keep users informed and in charge. Clear, consistent feedback lowers phishing success rates while accommodating cognitive impairments.

Together, these principles weave accessibility and security into the system architecture instead of bolting them on later.
