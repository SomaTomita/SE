# Question : (maximum of 150 words)

### Context

Software systems often need updates long after initial deployment. These updates, whether driven by user demands, environmental changes, or defect corrections, introduce their own challenges. Maintenance is not simply about fixing bugs; it's about managing complexity, preserving system quality, and supporting future evolution under real-world pressures.

### Task

Identify and explain three major challenges faced during software maintenance.
For each challenge:

- State the challenge clearly,
- Explain how it impacts the system's long-term stability or changeability, and
- Provide a realistic example showing how this challenge could arise in a typical software project.

### Answer/Marking Criteria

- Clear identification of three relevant maintenance challenges, 3 marks (1 mark each)
- Clear explanation and contextual example for each challenge, 3 marks (1 mark each)

## Answer

The first major challenge in software maintenance is technical debt and system complexity, which significantly impacts system modifiability and maintenance costs. For instance, in a project management system that has evolved over five years, quick fixes and workarounds have resulted in a complex codebase where new feature implementation takes three to four times longer than initially estimated.

A second critical challenge involves integration and compatibility issues with external dependencies. As systems evolve, maintaining compatibility becomes increasingly difficult and can break existing functionality. This is evident in web applications relying on multiple third-party APIs, where updates to security protocols require simultaneous modifications across multiple integration points while preserving system stability.

The third significant challenge concerns knowledge management and documentation. Poor documentation and inadequate knowledge transfer severely hamper system maintenance and evolution. This becomes particularly problematic when maintaining legacy systems where critical business logic remains undocumented and original developers have departed, forcing teams to conduct extensive code analysis with high risks of unintended consequences.
