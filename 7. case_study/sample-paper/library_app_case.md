# Library Mobile App Development

## Question (Maximum 150 words)

The University of London Library Services has announced the development of a new mobile application to help students manage their book loans. The app should allow students to view borrowed books, renew items, receive due date alerts, and search for library materials.

You have been assigned as the mobile app developer on this project and are responsible for leading the development process using a Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) approach.

### Task

Identify and describe the first four key SDLC phases you would follow to manage the development of this mobile app.

For each phase, you should:

- State the phase and explain the key deliverable or output of that phase (e.g. user stories, product backlog)
- Briefly justify how this phase helps address the challenges of building a user-focused mobile app

## Answer

Project Planning establishes the charter, budget, backlog, and risk register that frame what a library-loan app must achieve within term-time constraints, ensuring stakeholders share a delivery timetable before a single line of code is written.

Requirements Analysis then converts stakeholder interviews and usage analytics into user stories and acceptance criteria such as “receive a push alert one day before a book is due” and “search for available titles by keyword,” giving the team measurable definitions of success.

System Design transforms those stories into interactive Figma prototypes, navigation maps, and a service-oriented architecture that joins the mobile client to the library’s discovery and authentication APIs, safeguarding usability and data integrity.

Implementation finally turns blueprints into Kotlin and Swift code held in a CI/CD pipeline with automated linting and unit tests, producing a secure, cross-platform beta that renews items offline and syncs changes seamlessly when the device reconnects.

### Assessment Criteria

(1 mark for each phase, 1 mark for each deliverable, 1 mark – Justification/ explanation is clearly linked to the scenario’s needs and reflects an understanding of phase strengths/limitations)
