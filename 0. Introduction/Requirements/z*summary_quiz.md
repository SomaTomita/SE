# Requirements Engineering and UCD Summary Quiz

## Questions and Answers

### Q1: What is the primary focus of User-Centred Design (UCD)?

**Correct Answer**: Ensuring the end-user's needs are prioritised throughout the design process

**Explanation**:

- UCD is fundamentally about putting users at the center of the design process
- Other options (speed, efficiency, costs) are important but secondary to user needs
- This aligns with ISO 9241-210:2019 principles

### Q2: Select all activities that are part of requirements engineering:

**Correct Answers**:

- Elicitation
- Documentation
- Validation

**Explanation**:

- These are core activities in the requirements engineering process
- Software deployment is part of implementation, not requirements engineering
- Each activity serves a specific purpose in understanding and documenting needs

### Q3: Which techniques are commonly used in UCD to understand user needs?

**Correct Answers**:

- Usability testing
- Personas
- User journey mapping

**Explanation**:

- These are established UCD methods for understanding users
- Coding workshops are development activities, not UCD techniques
- Each method provides different insights into user needs and behaviors

### Q4: Match the following concepts to their definitions:

**Correct Matches**:

- Functional Requirements → "Specifies what the system must do"
- Non-Functional Requirements → "Captures how a system performs tasks"
- Requirements Elicitation → "The process of gathering stakeholder needs"

**Explanation**:

- Functional requirements define system behaviors
- Non-functional requirements define quality attributes
- Elicitation is about gathering and understanding needs

### Q5: Match the UCD method to its purpose:

**Correct Matches**:

- Personas → "Represent the goals, behaviours, and challenges of a user"
- Usability Testing → "Observe real users interacting with the system"
- User Journey Mapping → "Map the steps a user takes to achieve a goal"
- Contextual inquiry → "Organising information in a way that makes sense to users"

**Explanation**:

- Each method serves a specific purpose in understanding users
- Methods complement each other for comprehensive user understanding
- Selection depends on project needs and constraints

### Q6: Functional requirements describe how a system performs its tasks.

**Correct Answer**: False

**Explanation**:

- Functional requirements describe what a system does
- How the system performs tasks relates to non-functional requirements
- This is a fundamental distinction in requirements engineering

### Q7: Requirements engineering is an [iterative] process that includes elicitation, analysis, and validation.

**Correct Answer**: iterative

**Explanation**:

- Requirements engineering is not linear
- It requires multiple cycles of refinement
- Each phase may need to be revisited as understanding improves

### Q8: In ISO 9241-210:2019, the term [human-centred design] is used to emphasise that impacts on all stakeholders are considered, not just users.

**Correct Answer**: human-centred design

**Explanation**:

- Reflects broader consideration of all stakeholders
- Emphasizes inclusive design approach
- Aligns with modern design thinking

### Q9: Match the term with its correct definition:

**Correct Matches**:

- Stakeholder → "An individual or group with an interest in the system"
- Non-functional requirement → "A requirement that specifies the system's performance or constraints"
- Prototyping → "A preliminary model built to test design concepts"
- Usability → "A quality attribute that assesses how easy a system is to use"

**Explanation**:

- Each term represents a key concept in UCD and requirements engineering
- Understanding these definitions is crucial for effective practice
- Terms are interconnected in the design process

### Q10: In user-centred design, creating a [prototype] helps you test and refine design ideas with real users before full-scale development.

**Correct Answer**: prototype

**Explanation**:

- Prototypes are essential for early user feedback
- They reduce development risks
- Allow for iterative refinement of design ideas

## Summary of Key Points

1. UCD prioritizes user needs throughout the design process
2. Requirements engineering is iterative and includes multiple activities
3. Various techniques support understanding user needs
4. Clear distinction between functional and non-functional requirements
5. Importance of prototyping in the design process
