# Introduction to Requirements Engineering

## What is Requirements Engineering?

Requirements Engineering is a critical discipline within software development that focuses on defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system. It serves as the foundation upon which successful software projects are built, ensuring that the final product meets the needs of its stakeholders and fulfills its intended purpose.

At its core, requirements engineering is about answering a fundamental question: "What should the system do?" Before developers write a single line of code, there must be a clear understanding of what the software needs to accomplish and how it should behave.

## Understanding Requirements

Requirements are descriptions of the services that a system should provide and the constraints on its operation. They represent the expectations, needs, and limitations that guide the entire development process and help align the understanding of all stakeholders involved.

Requirements generally fall into different categories:

### User Requirements

User requirements focus on what users expect from the system, expressed in simple, non-technical language that is easy to understand. These requirements describe the system from the user's perspective.

**Example:** "The system should allow group members to vote on destinations for a holiday."

### System Requirements

System requirements provide detailed technical specifications that describe how the system will function. These are more specific and technical than user requirements.

**Example:** "The system shall store traveling date and voting data securely and update results in real time."

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe what the system must do—the specific behaviors, features, or functions it should perform. They directly contribute to the main purpose of the software.

**Examples:**

- The system must allow users to register for an account
- The system must enable users to make payments
- The system must send confirmation emails after bookings

### Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements focus on how the system performs its functions rather than what it does. These requirements address qualities such as performance, security, usability, and reliability.

**Examples:**

- The system must handle 1,000 simultaneous users
- The system must load pages within 2 seconds
- The system must ensure data privacy through encryption
- The system must be accessible to users with disabilities

## The Requirements Engineering Process

Requirements engineering consists of four main processes that work together to ensure that all stakeholders' needs are understood and documented correctly.

### 1. Elicitation

Elicitation is the process of gathering requirements from stakeholders and other sources. It's about discovering what different stakeholders need and expect from the system.

**Techniques include:**

- Interviews and surveys
- Brainstorming sessions
- Focus groups and workshops
- Observation of existing systems
- Prototyping
- Use case modeling

**Holiday Planning Analogy:** This is like speaking with everyone in your group to gather their holiday preferences—where they want to go, what activities they enjoy, and how much they can afford.

### 2. Analysis

Analysis involves examining the gathered information to ensure the requirements are clear, consistent, and realistic. This step identifies conflicts, overlaps, and ambiguities in the requirements.

**Activities include:**

- Organizing and prioritizing requirements
- Resolving conflicts between stakeholder needs
- Identifying dependencies between requirements
- Ensuring requirements are feasible and testable

**Holiday Planning Analogy:** After gathering everyone's preferences, you analyze this information to ensure all requirements are well-defined and feasible. If one person wants a beach holiday while another prefers mountains, you need to resolve this conflict.

### 3. Documentation

Documentation creates a clear and organized record of the requirements that have been elicited and analyzed. This serves as a reference point for all stakeholders and development team members.

**Common documentation formats:**

- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- User stories
- Use cases
- Wireframes and mockups
- Data flow diagrams

**Holiday Planning Analogy:** Creating a detailed holiday itinerary that includes agreed-upon activities, travel dates, and costs, ensuring everyone in the group is aligned.

### 4. Validation

Validation ensures that the documented requirements are accurate, complete, and agreed upon by all stakeholders. This step confirms that the requirements truly reflect the stakeholders' needs.

**Validation methods:**

- Stakeholder reviews
- Prototyping sessions
- Walkthroughs and inspections
- Formal requirement reviews

**Holiday Planning Analogy:** Confirming with the group that the planned itinerary aligns with their preferences and constraints, such as budgets or travel dates.

## The Importance of Requirements Engineering

Effective requirements engineering is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Ensures software delivers value:** By clearly understanding what users and stakeholders need, developers can create software that provides real benefits.

2. **Reduces development costs:** Identifying and fixing issues during the requirements phase is significantly less expensive than making changes later in development or after deployment.

3. **Minimizes misunderstandings:** Clear requirements help prevent confusion and ensure all team members and stakeholders share the same vision for the project.

4. **Provides a foundation for testing:** Well-defined requirements serve as the basis for creating test cases and validating that the system functions as expected.

5. **Facilitates change management:** Documented requirements make it easier to assess the impact of proposed changes and maintain the system over time.

## Conclusion

Requirements engineering is about understanding and defining what a software system must achieve before development begins. Just as a well-planned journey is likely to provide an enjoyable holiday, well-defined requirements are likely to meet user and stakeholder expectations.

By following a structured approach to eliciting, analyzing, documenting, and validating requirements, development teams can build software that truly meets the needs of its users and provides value to all stakeholders involved.

# Quiz Answers

### Question 1: What is the primary purpose of requirements engineering?

**Correct Answer: To identify, analyse, and document stakeholders' needs**

Explanation of choices:

- **To reduce project costs**: Incorrect. While effective requirements engineering can help reduce costs by minimizing rework, this is a benefit rather than the primary purpose.
- **To identify, analyse, and document stakeholders' needs**: Correct. The fundamental purpose of requirements engineering is to understand and document what stakeholders need from the system, ensuring that the final product meets those needs.
- **To create technical specifications for developers**: Incorrect. Creating technical specifications is part of the process, particularly in the documentation phase, but it's not the primary purpose of requirements engineering as a whole.
- **To build prototypes for testing**: Incorrect. Prototyping is one technique that might be used during requirements elicitation or validation, but it's a tool rather than the primary purpose.

### Question 2: In the group holiday example, creating a detailed itinerary including activities, travel dates, and costs corresponds to the \***\*\_\_\*\*** step in the requirements engineering process.

**Correct Answer: Documentation**

Explanation: In the requirements engineering process, the Documentation step involves creating a clear and organized record of the requirements that have been gathered and analyzed. The example of creating a detailed holiday itinerary with activities, travel dates, and costs directly corresponds to this step, as it represents formalizing and recording the agreed-upon requirements in an organized way that all stakeholders can reference.

### Question 3: In the requirements engineering process, \***\*\_\_\*\*** ensures that the documented requirements are accurate, complete, and agreed upon by all stakeholders.

**Correct Answer: Validation**

Explanation: Validation is the process that focuses on confirming that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholders' needs and expectations. This step involves reviewing requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are complete, consistent, and accurately capture what the system needs to do. In the holiday planning analogy, this is like confirming with the group that the planned itinerary aligns with their preferences and constraints.
