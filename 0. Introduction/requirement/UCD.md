# User-Centered Design (UCD)

## Introduction

User-Centered Design (UCD), also known as Human-Centered Design, is a comprehensive approach to software development that places users at the heart of the design process. According to ISO 9241-210:2019, this methodology considers not only end-users but also the impacts on various stakeholders throughout the development lifecycle.

## Core Principles

### 1. Empathy

- **User Understanding**: Deeply comprehend users' emotions, experiences, and motivations
- **Perspective Taking**: View the product from users' viewpoint
- **Continuous Involvement**: Engage users throughout the entire design process

### 2. User Focus

- **Need-Driven Development**: Base design decisions on real user problems and requirements
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Study how users interact with similar solutions
- **Goal Orientation**: Align features with user objectives

### 3. Iterative Design

- **Continuous Refinement**: Regular updates based on user feedback
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Gradual improvement of features
- **Flexible Adaptation**: Ability to change based on new insights

### 4. Usability

- **Ease of Learning**: Intuitive interface design
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined user workflows
- **Accessibility**: Inclusive design for users with varying abilities

## Key UCD Methods

### 1. Personas

Fictional but data-based user representations that help teams understand their target audience.

Example Persona:

- Name: Sarah Thompson
- Age: 29

Step-by-step mapping of user interactions with the product.

Example Journey for Holiday Planning App:

1. Open app
2. Invite group members
3. Collect preferences
4. Vote on destinations
5. Finalize bookings

### 3. Usability Testing

Systematic observation of user interaction with the product.

Example Scenario:

- Task: Book a hotel within a set budget
- Observation Points:
  - Navigation efficiency
  - Decision-making process
  - Pain points encountered
  - Time to completion
