# Introduction to SOLID Principles

## What are SOLID Principles?

SOLID principles are a set of five design guidelines that help developers create maintainable and scalable software. These principles ensure that code remains adaptable, readable, and easy to modify as requirements change over time.

## Why SOLID Principles Matter

Consider a Food Delivery App that constantly evolves with new features like real-time tracking, personalized promotions, and additional payment options. Without structured design principles, adding new functionality might break existing features, making maintenance difficult. SOLID principles help prevent these problems.

## The Five SOLID Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change.

**Example**: Instead of having a single `DeliveryService` class that handles driver assignments, order status updates, and payment processing, separate these responsibilities into distinct classes:

- `OrderManager`
- `DeliveryScheduler`
- `PaymentProcessor`

**Benefit**: When payment processing needs to change, you can modify only the `PaymentProcessor` without risking effects on delivery assignments or order management.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**Definition**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Example**: For payment methods in our food delivery app:

- Create a `PaymentMethod` interface
- Implement separate classes for each payment type: `CreditCardPayment`, `WalletPayment`, `CryptoPayment`

**Benefit**: New payment methods can be added without modifying existing code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**Definition**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

**Example**: If all delivery drivers need to navigate to destinations:

- Create an abstract `Courier` class with appropriate navigation methods
- Implement `BicycleCourier` and `CarDriver` with navigation strategies suitable for their transportation modes

**Benefit**: Any courier type can be used interchangeably where the base type is expected, preventing unexpected failures.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Definition**: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

**Example**: Instead of a single `UserInterface` with methods for all user types:

- Create separate interfaces: `CustomerInterface` and `RestaurantInterface`
- Each user type implements only relevant functionality

**Benefit**: Classes only implement methods they actually need, keeping the system modular and preventing unnecessary dependencies.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

**Example**: For database access:

- Define a `DatabaseInterface`
- Implement concrete classes like `SQLDatabase` and `NoSQLDatabase`
- Have `OrderManager` depend on the interface, not concrete implementations

**Benefit**: The system becomes more flexible and adaptable to changes, such as switching database technologies.

## Practical Application

When applying SOLID principles to your projects:

1. Identify distinct responsibilities and separate them
2. Design for extension through interfaces and abstractions
3. Ensure subclasses maintain expected behaviors
4. Create focused interfaces that serve specific needs
5. Depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations

These small improvements in design lead to significant long-term benefits in code maintainability, testability, and adaptability to changing requirements.
