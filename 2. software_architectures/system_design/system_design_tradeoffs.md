# System Design Trade-offs: Making the Right Architectural Decisions

In system design, success often comes down to making the right trade-offs for your specific use case. This document explores key architectural trade-offs in modern system design, complete with real-world examples and case studies.

## 1. SQL vs NoSQL Trade-offs

### Key Considerations:

- **SQL**
  - Pros: Strong consistency, structured schemas, powerful query capabilities
  - Cons: Challenges in horizontal scaling, schema modifications
- **NoSQL**
  - Pros: Horizontal scalability, schema flexibility
  - Cons: Reduced consistency guarantees, limited query capabilities

### Case Study: E-commerce Platform

**Scenario**: An e-commerce platform needs to handle both transactional data (orders, payments) and product catalogs.

**Solution**:

- Order Processing: SQL (PostgreSQL)
  - Reason: Requires ACID transactions for payment processing
- Product Catalog: NoSQL (MongoDB)
  - Reason: Flexible schema for varying product attributes, high read scalability

## 2. Data Normalization vs Denormalization

### Key Considerations:

- **Normalization**
  - Pros: Data integrity, storage efficiency
  - Cons: Complex joins, potential performance impacts
- **Denormalization**
  - Pros: Improved read performance, reduced join complexity
  - Cons: Data redundancy, write complexity

### Case Study: Social Media Feed

**Scenario**: A social media platform needs to display user feeds with posts, likes, and comments.

**Solution**: Hybrid approach

- Normalized: User profiles, relationships
- Denormalized: Feed data (pre-computed likes, comment counts)
  - Reason: Optimize for read-heavy feed generation

## 3. CAP Theorem Trade-offs

### Key Considerations:

- **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data at the same time
- **Availability**: System remains operational despite failures
- **Partition Tolerance**: System continues functioning during network partitions

### Case Study: Banking vs Social Media

**Banking System**:

- Chooses CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)
- Reason: Cannot risk inconsistent account balances

**Social Media Platform**:

- Chooses AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)
- Reason: Temporary inconsistency acceptable for better user experience

## 4. Consistency Models

### Key Considerations:

- **Strong Consistency**
  - Pros: Immediate data accuracy
  - Cons: Higher latency, reduced availability
- **Eventual Consistency**
  - Pros: Better performance, higher availability
  - Cons: Temporary data inconsistencies

### Case Study: Real-time Collaboration Tool

**Scenario**: A document collaboration platform like Google Docs

**Solution**: Mixed consistency model

- Strong consistency for document structure
- Eventual consistency for cursor positions and presence indicators

## 5. Data Processing Approaches

### Key Considerations:

- **Batch Processing**
  - Pros: Computational efficiency, simpler error handling
  - Cons: High latency, delayed insights
- **Stream Processing**
  - Pros: Real-time results, immediate reactions
  - Cons: Complex state management, handling out-of-order data

### Case Study: Analytics Platform

**Scenario**: A platform processing user behavior analytics

**Solution**: Lambda Architecture

- Stream processing: Real-time dashboards, alerts
- Batch processing: Daily aggregations, complex analytics

## Conclusion

The key to successful system design lies not in finding the "perfect" solution, but in understanding these trade-offs and choosing the appropriate balance for your specific use case. Consider factors such as:

- Business requirements
- Scale requirements
- User experience expectations
- Development team capabilities
- Operational complexity

Remember that these decisions aren't permanent - successful systems often evolve their architecture as requirements change and scale increases.
