# Networking Fundamentals and Protocols

## IP Addressing and Data Packets

### IP Addressing

1. **IPv4**

   - 32-bit addresses
   - ~4 billion unique addresses
   - Standard format: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

2. **IPv6**
   - 128-bit addresses
   - Vastly increased address space
   - Future-proof solution

### Data Packets

1. **Packet Structure**

   - IP header (routing information)
   - Application layer data
   - Protocol-specific formatting

2. **Network Communication**
   - Sender/receiver IP addresses
   - Packet routing (Determine the optimal route using a routing dictionary called a routing table)
     - 192.168.1.10 → 192.168.1.1 (home router) → ISP router → internet → `172.16.254.5`（server）
   - Data transmission rules (HTTP, DNS, FTP)

#### Example IP Header

```
IP Header:
  Version: 4
  IHL: 5 (20 bytes)
  Total Length: 100 bytes
  Time to Live: 64
  Protocol: TCP (6)
  Header Checksum: 0x8A2E
  Source IP Address: 192.168.1.1
  Destination IP Address: 172.16.254.1
```

### Example: HTTP Request

This example shows an HTTP request sent from a client (192.168.1.1) to a web server (`172.16.254.1`):

```
HTTP Method: GET
URI: /example-page.html
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows ...)
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
```

## Transport Layer Protocols

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

1. **Characteristics**

   - Reliable communication
   - Connection-oriented
   - Three-way handshake
   - Sequence numbers
   - Guaranteed delivery

### TCP Three-Way Handshake

```
Client (192.168.1.10)                        Server (172.16.254.1)
        |                                           |
        | ----------- SYN (Seq=x) ------------->    | ① Connection Request
        |                                           |
        | <------ SYN-ACK (Seq=y, Ack=x+1) -------  | ② Acknowledgment + Response
        |                                           |
        | ----------- ACK (Ack=y+1) ------------->  | ③ Final Acknowledgment
        |                                           |
     [TCP connection established]          [TCP connection established]
```

2. **Use Cases**
   - Web browsing
   - Email
   - File transfer
   - Database connections

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

   - No connection establishment
   - No guaranteed delivery
   - No packet order guarantee

2. **Use Cases**
   - Video calls
   - Live streaming
   - Gaming
   - Real-time applications

## DNS (Domain Name System)

### Basic Concepts

1. **Function**

   - Domain name (youtube.com) to IP translation (`192.168.5.1`)
   - Internet's "phone book"
   - Hierarchical naming system

2. **Components**
   - ICANN oversight (namecheap, godaddy)
   - Domain registrars (Services to manage the purchase and registration of domain name ownership for users)
   - DNS servers

### Record Types

1. **A Records**

   - Domain to IPv4 mapping
   - Direct IP association

2. **AAAA Records**
   - Domain to IPv6 mapping
   - Next-generation addressing

## Network Infrastructure

### IP Address Types

1. **Public IP**

   - Unique across internet
   - Internet-facing addresses

2. **Private IP**
   - Local network unique
   - Internal addressing

### Address Assignment

1. **Static IP**

   - Permanent IP address that does not change over time
   - Used for servers, printers, and infrastructure that require consistent addressability
   - Configured manually or reserved via DHCP reservation
   - Example: A web server hosting a site at `192.168.1.100` uses a static IP to ensure clients always reach it

2. **Dynamic IP**

   - Temporarily assigned by a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server
   - Common for home and mobile users where permanent IPs are unnecessary
   - IP address may change over time or upon network reconnect
   - Example: A laptop receives `192.168.0.10` from the router, but may receive a different address tomorrow

### Security

1. **Firewalls**

   - Monitor inbound and outbound network traffic
   - Enforce access control policies by allowing or blocking traffic based on rules
   - Protect systems from unauthorized access and attacks
   - Example: A firewall blocks incoming SSH (port 22) requests from external IPs to prevent brute force attacks

2. **Ports**

   - Identify services running on a device
   - Each service listens on a specific port number
   - Important for firewall configuration and traffic routing

   - **Standard Port Assignments:**
     - HTTP: 80 → Unencrypted web traffic
     - HTTPS: 443 → Encrypted web traffic
     - SSH: 22 → Secure remote login
     - SMTP: 25 → Outgoing email
     - DNS: 53 → Domain name resolution

## Application Layer Protocols

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

1. **Characteristics**

   - Request-response protocol for client-server communication
   - Stateless: Each request is independent and server maintains no session information
   - Text-based protocol running over TCP/IP
   - Example: When you visit "www.example.com", your browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server, which responds with the webpage content

2. **Status Codes**

   - 2xx: Success (200 OK - Request successful, 201 Created - Resource created)
   - 3xx: Redirection (301 Moved Permanently, 302 Found - Temporary redirect)
   - 4xx: Client Error (404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden)
   - 5xx: Server Error (500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable)
   - Example: When accessing a deleted webpage, server returns 404 Not Found

3. **Methods**
   - GET: Retrieve data (Safe, idempotent)
   - POST: Create new resources (Not idempotent)
   - PUT/PATCH: Update existing resources (Idempotent)
   - DELETE: Remove resources (Idempotent)
   - Example: A social media post creation uses POST, while updating profile uses PUT

### WebSocket

1. **Features**

   - Provides full-duplex, bi-directional communication
   - Maintains persistent connection after initial HTTP handshake
   - Significantly lower latency than HTTP polling
   - Example: A chat application where messages appear instantly without refreshing

2. **Applications**

### Email Protocols

1. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**

   - Primary protocol for sending emails between servers
   - Uses port 25 for unencrypted, 587 for encrypted communication
   - Handles outgoing mail delivery
   - Example: When sending email from outlook.com to gmail.com, SMTP handles server-to-server transfer

2. **IMAP/POP3 (Email Retrieval)**
   - IMAP (Interactive Mail Access Protocol)
     - Keeps emails on server
     - Supports multiple device synchronization
     - Example: Reading emails on both phone and computer, staying in sync
   - POP3 (Post Office Protocol)
     - Downloads emails to local device
     - Typically removes them from server
     - Example: Downloading all emails to desktop email client

### Real-time Communication Protocols

   - Example: Banking system processing thousands of transactions through message queues

### File Transfer Protocols

1. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**

   - Traditional protocol for transferring files between client and server
   - Uses separate channels for commands (port 21) and data transfer (port 20)
   - Supports basic authentication and file operations
   - Example: Web developer uploading website files to a hosting server using FileZilla FTP client

   **Common Operations:**

   - Upload/Download files
   - Create/Delete directories
   - List directory contents
   - Set file permissions

2. **SFTP/SSH (Secure File Transfer Protocol/Secure Shell)**

   - Encrypted file transfer protocol running over SSH
   - Provides secure remote access and file operations
   - Uses port 22 for all communications
   - Example: System administrator securely accessing a remote server to perform maintenance

   **Security Features:**

   - Public key authentication
   - Encrypted data transfer
   - Session-based connections
   - Example: Using private key authentication to automatically deploy code to production servers

### RPC (Remote Procedure Call)

1. **Functionality**

   - Enables programs to execute procedures (functions) on remote computers
   - Abstracts network communication details from developers
   - Supports synchronous and asynchronous operations
