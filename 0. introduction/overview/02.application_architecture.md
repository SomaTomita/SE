# System Design Principles and Core Concepts

## Fundamental Design Principles

### Key Design Elements

1. **Scalability**

   - System growth capability
   - Adapts to increasing user base

2. **Maintainability**

   - Code readability
   - Future development considerations

3. **Efficiency**
   - Resource optimization
   - Performance management

### Core Data Operations

1. **Moving Data**

   - Seamless data flow
   - Security considerations
   - Inter-system communication

2. **Storing Data**

   - Database selection (SQL/NoSQL)
   - Indexing strategies
   - Backup solutions

3. **Transforming Data**
   - Data aggregation
   - Format conversion
   - Log analysis

## CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem)

Principle that “in a distributed system, only two of the three can be satisfied at the same time.

### Core Components

1. **Consistency**

   - All nodes have same data
   - Real-time updates across nodes
   - Example: Google Docs synchronization where everyone can seee the same data

2. **Availability**

   - System remains operational
   - Responds to all requests
   - Example: Online store or the phone call are absolutely connected.

3. **Partition Tolerance**
   - System functions despite network issues
   - Continues operation during node communication failures
   - Example: Group chat functionality where even if one person loses connection, the rest of the group can can continue chatting

### Trade-offs

- Only **two properties** achievable simultaneously
- Example:
- CP: Banking systems prioritize consistency and partition tolerance over availability (If the data is so wrong, then it won't be displayed)
- AP: Shopping cart systems prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency (Even if there is a discrepancy between servers, it offers immediate cart updates for better user experience)
- CA: It is only theoretical (Want to have both complete consistency and availability, but not viable if the network breaks down)

## System Availability Metrics

An indicator of how long a system continues to operate without stopping.

### Availability Measurements

1. **Percentage Metrics**

   - 99.9% = 8.76 hours downtime/year
   - 99.99% = 5 minutes downtime/year

2. **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**

   - Performance goals
   - Example: 300ms response time for 99.9% of requests

3. **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**
   - Formal contracts between customers and providers
   - Compensation (penalty) is often charged for **violations** of availability or response time
   - Example: “If downtime falls below 99.9%, fees are partially refunded”

### System Resilience

1. **Reliability**

   - Consistent operation
   - Error handling

2. **Fault Tolerance**

- (Designed so that even if a part of the system breaks, the entire system does not stop)
- Failure management (Minimizes the impact of failures and keeps the system in a recoverable state)
- Attack resistance (Be strong enough to withstand attacks such as DDoS and vulnerabilities)

3. **Redundancy**
   - Backup systems
   - Failover capabilities (quickly switched over in the event of a failure.)

## Performance Metrics

### Throughput Measurements

1. **Server Throughput**

   - Requests per second (RPS)
   - Concurrent user handling

2. **Database Throughput**

   - Queries per second (QPS)
   - Processing capacity (Ability to handle complex JOIN and transaction processing)

3. **Data Throughput**
   - Bytes per second
   - Network transfer rates (Mbps)

### Latency

- Request-response time
- Trade-offs with throughput (Simultaneous processing of a large number of users, including batch processing and large volume data processing)
- Optimization strategies (Use a combination of cache utilization, CDN placement, asynchronous processing, load balancing, DB tuning, etc)
